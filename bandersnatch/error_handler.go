/*
	This file contains error handling code that get called whenever a NaP (Not-A-Point) is encountered.
	Apart from bugs within the library, such points can occur due to using uninitialized variables and continuing to work with them.
	Also, certain exceptional cases for some group operations can result in this (we take care they cannot appear while working on the good subgroup)
	To protect the user from mistakes (the naive implementation would give true for comparisons involving NaPs -- this is potentially a disaster if used in any kind of cryptographic verification),
	we check for NaP-ness whenever we "exit" the library, i.e. on Equality or Zero-Ness comparisons.
	If a NaP is found, we call an error handler that the user can replace by whatever they wish.
	Panic is appropriate here IMO, but there is a school of thought that strongly dislikes panic, so the user can choose.
