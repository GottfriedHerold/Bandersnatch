	checkfun_<foo> are functions of type checkfun (i.e. func(TestSample)(bool, string))
	They are to be run on TestSamples containing a Tuple of CurvePointPtrInterfaces and Flags and return true, <ignored> on success
	and false, optional_error_reason on failure.

	Be aware that our checkfunction also verify the intended behaviour at NaP's (even though we might not guarantee it)

	In some cases, the checkfunction needs an extra argument.
	E.g. when testing addition z.Add(x,y), the arguments x,y are given by the TestSample, but we need to specify the type of the receiver z intended to store the argument
	(this is important, as it selects the actuall method used), so we need an extra argument of type PointType (which is based on reflect.Type).
	In order to do that, we define functions with names
	make_checkfun_<foo>(extra arguments) that return checkfunctions with the extra arguments bound.
