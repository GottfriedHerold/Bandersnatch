## Call with 'source viewdoc' as browser-sync does not daemonize well, and this only works if exactly ONE terminal runs this.

# godoc is actually deprecated; the official suggestion is to use pkgsite. The documentation on this whole situation is atrocious.
# Furthermore, pkgsite is intended for static packages and even a local install does not reload on change. You actually have to restart the server to see changes!
# This requires browser-sync and nodemon (short for node-monitor, not for no-demon)

# So I follow https://mdaverde.com/posts/golang-local-docs/
# Only works in the current dir

browser-sync start --proxy "localhost:8080" --startPath $PWD  &
nodemon --signal SIGTERM --watch . --ext "go" --exec "browser-sync reload && ~/go/bin/pkgsite ."
~/go/bin/pkgsite
